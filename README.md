This screenshot may be out of date, but it should at least give you an idea of
the general look and feel of the theme.

There's still quite a lot of room for improvement, so feel free to share ideas
for possible improvements by opening an issue in the project's [issue tracker][2].
Even better, you can also fork the [repository][3] and send a pull request.

_However, please remember that color schemes are a very subjective topic, so
don't be offended if I ignore your contribution -- we don't all have the same
tastes._
